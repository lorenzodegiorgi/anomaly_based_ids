<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This work provides an overview of the different IDS technologies, considering also open issues and evaluation metrics used for evaluating the performance of intrusion detection systems. Section 3 is exclusively focused on a particular kind of IDS called anomaly-based, and discuss about the idea behind them, the algorithms used and the available tools.

Section 4 treats the main topic of this work, so it presents an overview of the open-source AIDS, Hogzilla IDS, exploring the main components and the general workflow.
Section 5 explained in more details the algorithms and the workflow, that will be tested in section 6 against benchmark datasets.
